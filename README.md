# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
This project focuses on creating an interactive map of earthquakes. It leverages layers and overlays to allow for a better graphical display with options.


## Results

Upon loading the website, the fault lines as well as the recent earthquakes from the last seven days are displayed on the map. You can zoom in and out for details. The magnitude of the earthquake is easy to see based on the size of the circles. In addition, a user is able to click on the marker and a popup is displayed with the magnitude and location of the earthquake. 

A user is also able to choose different map background modes:

* Streets (default)
* Satlellite
* Dark

For additional views of the earthquakes, these options are available:

* Earthquakes - recent (default)jj
* Techtronic Plates
* Major Earthquakes (greater than 4.5 magnitude)


## Summary

Leveraging Leaflet and Mapbox are key to providing fantastic user experiences with dynamic data!
